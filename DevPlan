In Rust
- Add rigorous testing for all of these functions
- Add account lockouts after too many attempts
- Add change password/account details
- Add confirmation for changing password
- Address possibility of two accounts having same name and website when creating the duplicate account
- Same for change master password, which could possibly be done by reusing the enter_new_master by adding a flag to see if it is a new user/if a user has passwords stored that need rencrypting
