In Rust
1. Build encryption tools
2. Build storage storage_options (add a change account info option and maybe an indexing system so it's easier to find things given the account name)
3. Test both to make sure they're working well
4. Set up the main function so that the master password is inserted, and there is a loop for user input (have it work in terminal)
5. Start working on front end
